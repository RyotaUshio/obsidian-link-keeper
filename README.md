## Installation

You can install the latest release using [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

1. Install the latest version of BRAT and enable it.
2. _(Optional but highly recommended)_ In the BRAT settings, turn on `Auto-update plugins at startup` at the top of the page.
3. Open the following URL in your browser: `obsidian://brat?plugin=RyotaUshio/obsidian-link-keeper`.
4. Click the "Add Plugin" button.

> [!warning]
> - **This plugin should be considered experimental**, and it has not been tested on operation systems other than macOS and iOS. If you encounter any problems, let me know by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-link-keeper/issues/new).
> - Files must be renamed or moved while Obsidian and this plugin are running; on iPad, it is fine to rename or move files while hiding a Slide Over window where Obsidian is running.
